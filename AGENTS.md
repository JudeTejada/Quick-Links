# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` holds the TanStack Start app; routes live in `src/routes/`, router setup is in `src/router.tsx`.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by TanStack Router; do not edit it manually.
- `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/context/`, and `src/lib/` contain reusable UI, hooks, and shared logic. Global styles live in `src/styles.css`.
- `public/` stores static assets, `convex/` contains Convex backend files, and `docs/` holds project notes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server on port 3000.
- `npm run build`: create a production build.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `npm run test`: run the Vitest suite once.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`: run ESLint checks or apply fixes.
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check`: format with Prettier or verify formatting.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript + React with strict compiler settings; prefer `@/` path aliases for `src` imports.
- Prettier defines formatting (2-space indentation by default); keep code ESLint-clean.
- Components use PascalCase, hooks use `useX`, and route files stay lowercase to match URLs.
- Keep generated router artifacts untouched and place reusable UI in `src/components`.

## Testing Guidelines

- Use Vitest with Testing Library for component tests.
- Name tests `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx` and co-locate them under `src/`.
- Add tests for new behavior; no coverage threshold is enforced yet.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages are short, imperative, and lowercase (example: `fix missing wrapper`).
- PRs should include a summary, testing notes (e.g., `npm run test`), linked issues, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration & Secrets

- Store local secrets in `.env.local` and keep them out of git.
- Document new environment variables in `README.md` when introducing them.
